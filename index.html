            <h2>What is Pipelining?</h2>
            <p>
                Pipelining is a technique in computer architecture where multiple instructions are overlapped during
                execution.
                It is similar to an assembly line where each instruction is broken into separate steps and processed in
                parallel.

            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>
                Modern software development demands rapid, reliable, and repeatable delivery of code changes into
                production.
                However, many small teams and students face significant constraints due to limited resources,
                infrastructure, and budget.
                The challenge is to create a cost-effective and lightweight DevOps pipeline that embodies
                industry-standard practices
                without relying on extensive tooling or complex setups.
            </p>

            <h2>Key Challenges</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Automated Integration and Deployment:</strong> Seamless code integration and deployment with
                    minimal manual work.</li>
                <li><strong>Resource Constraints:</strong> Efficient and accessible for small teams using free-tier
                    services.</li>
                <li><strong>Security and Reproducibility:</strong> Securely manage credentials while keeping the process
                    reproducible.</li>
                <li><strong>Simplicity and Impact:</strong> Clear demonstration of CI/CD principles in a simple and
                    effective setup.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Project Goals</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Establish an End-to-End CI/CD Pipeline: Integrate version control, testing, and deployment.</li>
                <li>Leverage Cloud Services: Use free-tier cloud tools for deployment and hosting.</li>
                <li>Ensure Secure and Automated Operations: Handle secrets securely to mimic real-world DevOps.</li>
                <li>Demonstrate Practical DevOps Principles: Show how automation enhances development cycles.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Project Aim</h2>
            <p>
                This project aims to address these challenges by designing and implementing a fully automated, secure,
                and efficient
                deployment pipeline that serves as a practical demonstration of modern DevOps methodologies.

            <h2>Stages of a Pipeline</h2>

            <div class="stage-box">
                <h3>1. Instruction Fetch (IF)</h3>
                <p>The processor fetches the instruction from memory based on the Program Counter (PC). This stage may
                    involve accessing instruction cache or memory.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="stage-box">
                <h3>2. Instruction Decode (ID)</h3>
                <p>The instruction is decoded to determine the operation to be performed. Operands may also be read from
                    the register file during this stage.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="stage-box">
                <h3>3. Execute (EX)</h3>
                <p>The ALU performs arithmetic/logical operations or address calculation required for the instruction.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="stage-box">
                <h3>4. Memory Access (MEM)</h3>
                <p>This stage involves accessing memory if required (e.g., for load/store operations).</p>
            </div>

            <div class="stage-box">
                <h3>5. Write Back (WB)</h3>
                <p>The result is written back to the register file, completing the instruction cycle.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
