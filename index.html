            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>Modern software development demands rapid, reliable, and repeatable delivery of code changes into production. However, many small teams and students face significant constraints due to limited resources, infrastructure, and budget. The challenge is to create a cost-effective and lightweight DevOps pipeline that embodies industry-standard practices without relying on extensive tooling or complex setups.</p>
